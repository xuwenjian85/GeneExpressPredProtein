use RNA expression profile to predict protein expression level more accurately than previous methods.
## Background
We comprehensively evaluated the machine learning models on inferring protein expression levels using RNA expression profile using 20 proteogenomic datasets.   
  Since the proteomic analysis is more expensive and challenging than transcriptomic analysis, the question of how to use mRNA expression data to predict protein level is central important. Here, a total of 20 proteogenomic datasets from three mainstream proteomic platforms, which consist of > 2500 samples of 13 human tissues, were collected for model evaluation. Our results highlight that the appropriate feature selection methods combined with classical machine learning models could achieve good predictive performance. Specifically, the weighted mean models outperform other candidate models across datasets. Adding proxy model to interaction model further improves the prediction performance. The dataset and gene characteristics would affect the prediction performance. Finally, we applied the model to brain transcriptome of cerebral cortex regions to infer protein profile. This benchmarking work not only provides useful hints on the inherent correlation between transcriptome and proteome, but also shows the practical value of the transcriptome-based protein level predication.
